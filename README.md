This repository aims to investigate <em><strong>if human collaboration can improve the performance of detecting LLM-generated deepfake texts</em></strong>, which includes the data and codes of MTurk human studies.


The work is to support the [AAAI HCOMP 2023](https://www.humancomputation.com/) paper 
["Does Human Collaboration Enhance the Accuracy of Identifying LLM-Generated Deepfake Texts?"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01002.pdf)
 by Adaku Uchendu*, Jooyoung Lee∗, Hua Shen∗, Thai Le, Ting-Hao ‘Kenneth’ Huang, Dongwon Lee.

# Download the dataset

You can check and download the [dataset](generate_hit_htmls/data_gpt2_trial.csv) used in this study. 

The dataset includes 50 instances (articles), in which each instance (article) cnosists of three paragraphs. Within the three paragraphs, one random-selected paragraph is generated by LLM and the other two are written by humans.


# Download all data in repo

You can also download [all data in this repo](https://github.com/huashen218/llm-deepfake-human-study/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a zip file, which include the aforementioned dataset and the codes to conduct human study with Amazon MTurk.



# Human Study of dinstinguishing Paragraphs Generated by Humans or AI Machines?


### Step1: Design the templates of "Group1" and "Group2"

```
root_dir = 'the project path'
group1_template = os.path.join(root_dir, generate_hit_htmls, "group1_template.html")
group2_template = os.path.join(root_dir, generate_hit_htmls, "group2_template.html")
```

### Step2: Generate All HITs with data & templates;

```
cd root_dir/generate_hit_htmls
$ python generate_hits.py

All generated HIT htmls are saved in "root_dir/generate_hit_htmls/htmls/group1
```

### Step3: Deploy HITs to MTurk.

```
cd root_dir/deploy_mturk/product

To create HITs:
$ python create_hit_product.py

To retrieve HITs:
$ python retrieve_hit_product.py

```
